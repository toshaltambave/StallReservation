Source code of my first internship at Mahindra & Mahindra in 2014 developing a reservation system for booths spread across the organisation. This is a very old project & infact my very first project. Most of the code or practices used aren't ideal programming choices.
This application was build during my second year in college trying to figure out how web applications are built
